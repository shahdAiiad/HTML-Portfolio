<h2>My top 3 C-drama Series of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The First Frost</h3>
<p> I don't think any drama will beat this. I wish I could give this 1000/10. The First Frost portrays one of the most selfless and enduring love I have ever seen in any drama. It tells the story of Sang Yan and Yi Fan who fell in love in high school. </p>

<h3>When I Fly Towards You</h3>
<p> This is a feel good type of drama there are no love triangles, no unnecessary misunderstandings, just a beautifully written story about love and friendships. </p>

<h3>Heddin Love</h3>
<P>  Hidden Love is a story about little girls and their little girl dreams of true love. I liked the realistic way the story about first love, which turns into everlasting love, was handled. This drama is so well written, engaging and well acted. </P>
